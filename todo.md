# TODO
- Test C->Python using Python Bindings
- Create simulation program to generate traffic randomly according to a given distribution
  - Starts at midnight and goes to next midnight
  - Follows normal distribution
  - Random variation at any given time
  - 2 intersection possibility
    - Pass-through intersection, where the majority of traffic on one lane and moves straight through
    - Random, where traffic evenly spawns and moves in all directions
- Research current traffic algorithms
- Create main program
  - Test
  - Valgrind
- GUI
- Python Handler
  - Generate 5 traffic files
  - Runs the standard model on each one, records penalty
  - Trains Neural Network on the 5 files for 5 generations
  - Save penalty to output file (with epoch number)
  - Restart (Do this 1,000,000 times)
  - To step it up, we can increase the traffic files we do at 1 time, or do 1 traffic file for 1 generation, and do more generations overall
- Learn LaTeX to create final report
